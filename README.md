# Load-Balancing Simulator

A **High Performance Computing (HPC) Load Balancing Simulator** that visualizes task distribution among workers using different load balancing strategies. This simulator helps understand how tasks are assigned and processed in real-time for various strategies like Round Robin, Least Loaded, Random, and Static Partitioning.

## Features

- Simulate task assignment for multiple workers.
- Supports 4 load balancing strategies:
  - **Round Robin**
  - **Least Loaded**
  - **Random**
  - **Static Partitioning**
- Real-time visualization of worker loads and task progress.
- Step-by-step simulation with pause/resume and reset.
- Performance metrics including:
  - Total simulation time
  - Average task completion time
  - Maximum task completion time
  - Load imbalance and variance
  - Efficiency of task distribution
